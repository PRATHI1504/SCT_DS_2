In this analysis, I explored a dataset that examines the relationship between GDP per capita and happiness scores across countries. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I visualized the distribution of happiness scores, identified trends in GDP per capita, and analyzed the correlation between key numerical variables.

Key steps included:

Data Cleaning: Addressing missing values and ensuring the integrity of the dataset.
Visualizations: Using histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots to illustrate relationships between variables.
Correlation Matrix: Analyzing numerical data to understand inter-variable relationships.
The insights from this analysis shed light on the strong correlation between wealthier countries and higher happiness scores, offering a foundation for further exploration and more complex modeling. This work highlights how data-driven approaches can uncover valuable patterns that drive decision-making.
